# student-directory #

Since the begin of time we were looking for an answer, answer on how to manage the Student Directory of
the Villian Academy. But NOW, we have this new script that will allow YOU, yeah YOU user to do it in the
most simple and efficient way.

This is the first project made on the pre-course ar Makers Academy, is quite messy but I'm proud to say that this is how I started coding and I can see that I've learned a lot since this project.

# How to use it #

The names of the person written on this Directory will die... wait, no... those were the death note instructions.

## Setting up

Before starting the directory you must create a file in the project folder, so in the command line write:
```
touch students.csv
```
note: Actually you can use any name you want for the file, just remember to add it on .gitignore so no one can see your students.

## How to start it:

Run the following on the command line:

``` shell
ruby directory.rb
```

## Once it is started
it will ask for a file, this would be "students.csv" or the name you've chosen.

then, you will see 9 options:

- "1. Input the students"
- "2. Show the students"
- "3. Search for specific students"
- "4. Save the students in a file"
- "5. loads the students in the file"
- "6. Print the program source code"
- "9. Exit"

they basically do what they say.
